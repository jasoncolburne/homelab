# homelab

A detailed walkthrough of my home lab build. I plan to use this to:
- Set up my own cloud-like infrastructure to play with
- Provide a mechanism to create realtime, failsafe backups
- Perform further [quantum computing research](https://github.com/jasoncolburne/QuantumComputer.jl) through simulation
- Begin AI and ML research
- Produce music
